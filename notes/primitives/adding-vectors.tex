\section*{Add one specific vector to the $i$th}

The $i$ is fixed from the construction of the transformer, it's assumed that is flagged with a $1$ in the last coordinate. 
Therefore all vectors with have $0$ in their last coordinate with the exception of the $i$th which will have a $1$.

Lets call $v$ the vector that we want to add. We will do it with one layer of FF. We will construct a layer such that $FF(h_j) = \mathbb{I}(j=i)*v$.

\begin{align*}
    & W_1 = id
    & W_2  = \left(\begin{matrix}
        & 0         &\dots  &0      & v_1       \\
        & \vdots    &\ddots &\vdots & \vdots    \\
        & 0         &\dots  &0      & v_d       \\
    \end{matrix}\right) &
    & b_1 = b_2 = \left(\begin{matrix}
        & 0      \\
        & \vdots \\
        & 0      \\
    \end{matrix}\right) 
\end{align*}

If we were to choose the $k$th coordinate for the flag instead of the last one, then we would have to put $v$ in the $k$th column.

\subsubsection*{Make the $i$th vector zero}

With just adding a fixed vector we can transform any vector to a constant one. For that we will first make it zero and then add the one we want. Lets see the first part.

For all $x$ it happens that $(x + \infty) + \infty = \infty$. Since $x \ge -\infty$, it happens that $x + \infty \ge 0$, then $(x + \infty) + \infty \ge \infty$, so $(x + \infty) + \infty = \infty$. Therefore if we want to get zero, it's enough to subtract $\infty$.

\begin{align*}
    h_i \leftarrow \left(\left( h_i + 
    \left(\begin{matrix}
    &\infty \\
    &\vdots \\
    &\infty \\
\end{matrix}\right)\right)
    + \left(\begin{matrix}
    &\infty \\
    &\vdots \\
    &\infty \\
\end{matrix}\right)\right)
    + \left(\begin{matrix}
    &-\infty \\
    &\vdots \\
    &-\infty \\
\end{matrix}\right)
\end{align*}
