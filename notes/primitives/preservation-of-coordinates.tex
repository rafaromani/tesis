\section*{ATTN y FF controlling which coordinates are affected}
%maybe i should write the equations? is it worth?
Later we will see that we want to go trough layers of attention and feed forward ignoring some coordinates. That means without taking them into consideration and without affecting them in the output.

For example, if we want to ignore the $i$th coordinate trough a layer of attention, it's enough to put zeros in the $i$th column and row of $W_Q, W_K, W_V, W_O$. This can be done with as many coordinates as desired. Note that because the $i$th row of $W_O$ is zero, the output vector of the ATTN layer will have a zero in the $i$th coordinate. This is the point that makes it possible to not just ignore the value of the $i$th coordinate but to not affect it. This happens because the result of the attention is added to the original vector.

The same applies in the feed forward layer, putting zeros in the $i$th column and row of the matrix and vectors of the FF makes it ignore the value of the $i$th coordinate. Also in the result of the FF will appear a zero in the $i$th coordinate.
