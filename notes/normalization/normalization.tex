\maketitle

We will define two notions of normalization for transformers. Both concern the value of the last vector before finishing the loop, which the paper calls $h_n^L$. We will also require that the output matrix be a projection.

Note that this definitions are written for the alphabet $\{0,1\}$ but they can clearly be extended to a more rich one. Also this definitions were written considering that a transformer accepts when it prints a $1$ and rejects when it prints a $0$ but it can be slightly modified so it works with our definition.
